# PySamples

This is some sample code written by Fred (Sita-Rama) Machuga as part of learning Python. 

This is not following any tutorials, but instead:
- just banging on stuff
- using Google to find new python knowledge sources on the Net.

As this code does nothing, the license is ... DWETFUW ... 

To run the demo:

    python demo/PeopleStorage.py
    
or

    ./demo/PeopleStorage.py
